# Student Grade Calculator 📊

A Python automation tool that manages student exam scores using **File Handling**. This project reads raw student data from a text file, calculates the average scores, assigns letter grades (AA-FF), and exports the results to a separate file.

## 🚀 Features
* **Data Processing:** Reads student names and 3 exam scores from `sinav_notlari.txt`.
* **Auto-Calculation:** Computes the average score automatically.
* **Grade Assignment:** Assigns letter grades (AA, BA, BB, etc.) based on specific ranges.
* **Safe Storage:** Saves the calculated results to a new file (`sonuclar.txt`), keeping the original data safe.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `main.py`: The main script containing the logic and file handling operations.
* `sinav_notlari.txt`: The input file containing sample student data (Name:Score1,Score2,Score3).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python 3.x**
* **File I/O Operations** (Read, Write, Append modes)
* **String Manipulation**
